I was introduced to FIRST in 8th grade through FLL, and since then, I helped to jump start Farmington's FTC program along with joining the FRC team during my freshman year. Being on an FTC and FRC team allows me to combine my love of math and computer science in order to make mechanical systems move effectively. In my off time, I enjoy playing the violin and teaching younger students.</center></p>
