                <p className="teamdescription"><center>In 2016, all our team members participated in different FLL teams in our community. We enjoyed this experience very much, and we wanted to participate in a robotics competition for another season. Since we were growing older, we realized that FTC would be a better fit for each of us. We call came together as an FTC team in 2017 to share our love of coding, engineering, and everything that FIRST stands for. As a small, rookie, community-based team, we faced our fair share of challenges in our first year. However, with teamwork and a lot of late nights, we had a successful first few seasons, ultimately becoming a team on the winning alliance at the CT state championships in February of 2020 . In addition to showcasing our proficiency in engineering and coding discplines, we strive to empower each other on the team to grow, both intellectually and as global citizens. One of our priorities is to pursue opportunities outside the robotics field, both at school and in the community, so that we can enrich ourselvses and utilize our critical thinking and FIRST ideals in a variety of environments. We also foster a strong sense of team spirit, taking pride in all our team has achieved while recognizing our weaknesses. We work diligently as a team to maintain a record of success and failures to foster growth through meaningful reflection.</center></p>
